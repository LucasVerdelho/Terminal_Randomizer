# Terminal_Randomizer
A script that changes the appearance of a Windows Terminal, randomly selecting background, foreground colors as well as the background image/gif




## How to Use
I have included a preset *settings.json* file which you will need to change the paths I have included, I may still implement an initializer later on, but for now manual changes will have to suffice.

### How to Find the Paths
I recommend using the voidtools' *Everything Search* for this, but the terminal executable is generally located in the path i have included in the *input.txt*, being called "wt.exe".

For the retro shader effects on the terminal just change the path of the .hlsl file to where you downloaded the repository.
