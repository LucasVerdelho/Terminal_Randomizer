## How to Use
1. Make sure you have installed the Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store.

2. You will also need to have python installed and to have this repository downloaded somewhere on your pc where you will be able to remember it's location.





I have included a preset **settings.json** file which you will need to change the paths I have included, I may still implement an initializer later on, but for now manual changes will have to suffice.

### How to Find the Paths
I recommend using the voidtools' **Everything Search** for this, but the terminal executable is generally located in the path i have included in the **input.txt**, being called **"wt.exe"**.

For the retro shader effects on the terminal just change the path of the .hlsl file to where you downloaded the repository.
