## How to Use
I have included a preset **settings.json** file which you will need to change the paths I have included, I may still implement an initializer later on, but for now manual changes will have to suffice.

### How to Find the Paths
I recommend using the voidtools' **Everything Search** for this, but the terminal executable is generally located in the path i have included in the **input.txt**, being called **"wt.exe"**.

For the retro shader effects on the terminal just change the path of the .hlsl file to where you downloaded the repository.
